# NestJS

# **Opinionated**
# MVC
# **Decorators** are TypeScript annotations (starting with @)
# **Providers** are the same as Components in the Spring Framework
# **Pipes** are a type of middleware, using as transformers or validators

## Setup

- nest new <name>
- nest g module <name> 
- nest g service <name> 
- nest g controller <name> 

### Controllers
- The order of endpoints matters. More specific routes should be defined before less specific ones.
