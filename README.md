# NestJS

# **Opinionated**
# MVC
# Decorators are TypeScript annotations (starting with @)
# Providers are the same as Components in the Spring Framework

## Setup

- nest new <name>
- nest g module <name> 
- nest g service <name> 
- nest g controller <name> 

### Controllers
- The order of endpoints matters. More specific routes should be defined before less specific ones.
